Hey 👋  

I took on the **Cloud Resume Challenge** and deployed my portfolio using **Azure**! This project showcases my skills in cloud services, serverless functions, and database integration.  

## 🚀 Features

- **Static Website** hosted on **Azure Storage**
- Visitor **tracking and analytics** using **Azure Cosmos DB**
- **Serverless backend** powered by **Azure Functions**

## 🛠️ Azure Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Azure Storage (Static Website) | Hosts the frontend of the portfolio |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Stores visitor count and other data |
| Azure Functions | Handles serverless logic, such as incrementing visitor count |

## 📂 Project Structure

- **frontend/** – HTML, CSS, and JS files for the portfolio website  
- **backend/** – Azure Functions code and configuration  
- **database/** – Cosmos DB collections and setup scripts  

## 🌐 Deployment

1. The static website is hosted on **Azure Storage**.
